# 🔥 Block Burner

**Block Burner** is a competitive falling-blocks game inspired by the game **Yahoo Towers**. This is a **beta version** with ongoing development and future plans to expand it into a 2–8 player head-to-head game. 
I am going to rewrite this game using Rust. When I started this project, I thought I could use Java anywhere, even in the browser. I think it would be less complicated in the long run to use Rust from the ground up.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The objective is simple but intense:

- **Burn your blocks** to prevent your grid from overflowing.
- Force your **opponent’s grid to fill up** to win.
- Use **offensive** and **defensive** power-up blocks to manipulate both grids.
- Spell **BURNER** in a row to unlock a **special power**, letting you send extra blocks to your opponent for a limited time.

This is a **real-time 2-player game** played on the **same keyboard**.
