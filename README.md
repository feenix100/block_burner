# 🔥 Block Burner

**Block Burner** is a competitive falling-blocks game inspired by the now-defunct **Yahoo Towers**. This is a **beta version** with ongoing development and future plans to expand it into a 2–8 player head-to-head game.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The objective is simple but intense:

- **Burn your blocks** to prevent your grid from overflowing.
- Force your **opponent’s grid to fill up** to win.
- Use **offensive** and **defensive** power-up blocks to manipulate both grids.
- Spell **BURNER** in a row to unlock a **special power**, letting you send extra blocks to your opponent for a limited time.

This is a **real-time 2-player game** played on the **same keyboard**.
